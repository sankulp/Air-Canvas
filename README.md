# Air-Canvas

This project implements an air canvas application using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries in Python. The application allows users to draw freely on a virtual canvas using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The canvas supports multiple colors, including blue, green, red, and yellow, enabling users to express their creativity with different drawing styles. Additionally, the application features a clear button for erasing the canvas and starting anew.

To use the application, simply run the provided Python script. Ensure that you have OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy installed in your Python environment. You can select different colors by hovering your hand over the respective color rectangles displayed on the canvas. To draw, simply move your finger across the canvas area, and lines will appear accordingly. When you're done, press the 'q' key to exit the application.
